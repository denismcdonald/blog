<h1 class="h1-title">About</h1>

This is a blog about [information architecture](https://www.iainstitute.org/what-is-ia), or in other words:

<!-- ![image](/assets/images/handshake.jpg) -->


> ...the structural design of shared information environments; the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability and findability; and an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design, architecture and information science to the digital landscape." &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture)

Me, I'm a final-year student undertaking a Master of Information Studies (Information Architecture) at [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au/), and yep, you guessed it: I'm casting out for an entry-level opportunity in this respect.

More personally, I live in Hamilton, Victoria, Australia, where I currently get my kicks spotting platypus, listening to [music to spazz by](http://wfmu.org/playlists/MS) and developing exotic running injuries.

Otherwise, by all means [say hello](mailto).
